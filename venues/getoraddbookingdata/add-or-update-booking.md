## Special Considerations

### Assigning a company/contact to the booking

The _contact type_ of a booking is either a _company_ **or** a _contact_. When _companyId_ **or** _company_ is present in the request then the _contact type_ of the booking is set to _company_, and the _contactId_ **or** _contact_ must be a contact that belongs to that company. Otherwise the _contact type_ of the booking is set to _contact_ and contactId can be any valid contact in the venue's account.

If _contact_ and _company_ are present in request then it will link given contact to company.

A quote (i.e. booking status is _prospective_) that is assigned to an opportunity is forced to have the same _companyId_ and _contactId_ of the opportunity. Trying to change these values to something else will have no effect when updating the quote.

### Adding an event template to a new booking

Setting _packageId_ in the request when adding a _new_ booking will attempt to add that event template to _all_ event days of the booking _after_ the booking is created. There is no guarantee that the event template will be successfully added to all days of the booking. When the event template cannot be added to the booking, one or more [warnings](add-or-update-booking.md#response-warnings) will be returned in the response.

There are also the following additional restrictions:

* An event template can only be added when the venue has function spaces.
* An event template can only be added to a [detailed](add-or-update-booking.md#booking-type) booking.
* The maximum number of event days when adding an event template is 7.
* _packagePrice_ will be rounded to 3 decimal places if present in the request.

### Updating a booking

Updating a booking (i.e. by setting _id_ in the request) is an overlay action. This means the request can include only the details of the booking to be changed. This does not necessarily mean the operation will succeed. For example, the request might include the _dateEventEnd_ value, and not the _dateEventStart_ value. This scenario will fail if the value of _dateEventEnd_ is earlier than the current _dateEventStart_ value of the booking.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| packageErrors        | The way the venue has configured the event template prevents it from being added to one or more event days of the booking.                          |
| packageSessionErrors | One or more sessions of the event template could not be added to the booking. This is usually caused by conflicting reservations on function space. |
