## Notes on adding a room reservation

This action only supports adding a "not confirmed" room reservation. To add a "confirmed" room reservation, you will need to call the [confirmBookingRoomReservation](confirm-booking-room-reservation.md#confirm-booking-room-reservation) action after a successfull add.

This action only supports adding a room reservation to a booking that has [accommodation groups](add-or-update-booking-accommodation.md#booking-accommodation-group). The [rooms](add-or-update-booking-room-reservation.md#reserved-room) on the reservation must be assigned to a group.

## Notes on updating a room reservation

Updating an existing room reservation **overlays** the existing data. Optional request data that is excluded will not change existing data \(with the exception of _additionalGuests_ - see below\). This does not guarantee that the request data will validate if other data is changed. For example, if the departure date of a reserved room is extended, rates for the **new** dates will be required.

The following is an example of an update request that updates an existing room \(_id_ 400\) and adds a new room:

```javascript
"rooms": [
  {
    "id": 400,
    "arrivalDate": "2019-01-01",
    "departureDate": "2019-02-03",
    "dayRates": [
      {
        "dayDate": "2019-01-01",
        "cost": 100
      },
      {
        "dayDate": "2019-01-02",
        "cost": 101
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "guest": {
      "id": 301
    },
    "groupId": 1,
    "arrivalDate": "2019-01-01",
    "departureDate": "2019-02-03",
    "numAdultGuests": 1,
    "numChildGuests": 0,
    "dayRates": [
      {
        "dayDate": "2019-01-01",
        "cost": 100
      },
      {
        "dayDate": "2019-01-02",
        "cost": 101
      }
    ]
]
```
Existing rooms can be **removed** from a reservation by passing their unique identifier in the _removeRooms_ of the request. Rooms are removed before other rooms in the request are added/updated.

### Updating additional guests on a reserved room

The _additionalGuests_ request param can be used to set the additional guest details of a reserved room. If this value is present in the request, it will become the **new** list of additional guests on the room. Therefore if you do **not** want to remove an additional guest, it must be present \(at least the _guestId_ value\) in the array.

If the value is **not** present in the request, the existing list of additional guests will remain. The details of the additional guests will still be validated against the updated reservation details. For example, if the _arrivalDate_ of the reserved rooms is updated, the new value will be validated against the existing additional guests. If the _arrivalDate_ of an existing additional guest is invalid, the request will be rejected.

## Notes on guest details in the request

Guests are **uniquely** identified based on the following \(in order\): 1\) The unique _id_ value of the guest. 2\) The combination of the guest's _email_, _firstName_, and _lastName_ \(case insensitive\).

Consider the following [guest](add-or-update-booking-room-reservation.md#guest) objects:

```javascript
{
  "id": 101,
  "primaryPhone": "123456789"
}

{
  "guestContact": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@somewhere.com",
  },
  "primaryPhone": "0419111222"
}
```

The first object will update the guest with the unique id _101_. The request will fail if the guest does not exist. Only the _primaryPhone_ of the guest will be updated.

The second object will either create a new guest or update an existing one. If a guest already exists with the _firstName_ "John", _lastName_ "Doe", and _email_ "john.doe@somewhere.com" then that guest will be updated \(only the _primaryPhone_ of the guest will be updated\). Otherwise a new guest will be created.

If the same guest details appear multiple times in the request, only the details of the **first** guest are applied. For example, consider the following request data \(some details are omitted for simplicity\):

```javascript
{
  "venueId": 13,
  "bookingId": 1413,
  "mainGuest": {
    "guestContact": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "John.Doe@somewhere.com",
      "phone": "12345678",
    },
    "primaryPhone": "12345678"
  },
  "rooms": [
    {
      "guest": {
        "guestContact": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "email": "John.Doe@somewhere.com",
          "phone": "87654321",
        },
        "primaryPhone": "87654321"
      },
      "groupId": 54,
      "arrivalDate": "2019-01-01",
      "departureDate": "2019-01-04"
    },
    {
      "guest": {
        "guestContact": {
          "firstName": "Jane",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "email": "Jane.Doe@somewhere.com",
          "phone": "123123123",
        },
        "primaryPhone": "123123123"
      },
      "groupId": 55,
      "arrivalDate": "2019-01-01",
      "departureDate": "2019-01-04"
    }
  ]
}
```

There are 2 **unique** guests in the above request data: John Doe, and Jane Doe. John Doe appears in the request twice \(first as _mainGuest_ and second as the _guest_ on the first room\). The details of the first appearance will be used when updating John Doe, therefore the _primaryPhone_ value will be "12345678", not "87654321".
