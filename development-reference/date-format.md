# Date Format

The iVvy API uses a date format to represent dates. The format is a simple text-based format in the following form:

`yyyy-mm-dd`

Where

* yyyy = The 4 digit year of the date
* mm = The two digit month of the date, where January = 01 and December = 12
* dd = The two digit day of the month
